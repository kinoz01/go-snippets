The `nil` value passed as the second argument to `ListenAndServe` represents the use of the `DefaultServeMux` as the HTTP request handler for the server.

### Understanding `DefaultServeMux`

- **What it is**: The `DefaultServeMux` is a built-in multiplexer (router) provided by the net/http package in Go. A multiplexer's job is to match incoming HTTP requests to their corresponding handler functions based on the request path.

- **How it works**: When you pass `nil` as the handler, the server internally uses the `DefaultServeMux`. The `DefaultServeMux` has some pre-registered handlers for specific paths.

- In `practice1` and `practice4` and `practice5` all the servers are using `nil` as the handler in `http.ListenAndServe`, it will use the `DefaultServeMux`, which means that both servers will end up using the same set of handlers (handlers of one server will works on the other, since they are basically using the same multiplexer).

- When you use `http.HandleFunc(pattern, handler)`, under the hood it's doing this:

```go
DefaultServeMux.HandleFunc(pattern, handler)
```
