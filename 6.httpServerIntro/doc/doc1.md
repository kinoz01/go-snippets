The creation and passing of `ResponseWriter` and ``*Request`` to your handler function happen within the `net/http` package, specifically in the implementation of the `http.Server` type and its associated methods. Let's take a closer look at the process:

1. **Listening for Connections:** When you call **`http.ListenAndServe`**, the server starts listening for incoming TCP connections on the specified port.

2. **Accepting Connections:** When a client connects, the server accepts the connection, creating a new `net.Conn` object to represent the connection between the client and server.

3. **Reading Request:** The server reads the HTTP request data from the `net.Conn`. This includes parsing the headers, the request method (GET, POST, etc.), the URL path, and any request body.

4. **Creating Request Object:** The server creates an **http.Request** object, populating it with the data parsed from the incoming request.

5. **Creating `ResponseWriter`:** The server creates a concrete implementation of the `http.ResponseWriter` interface. This implementation typically wraps the `net.Conn` object and provides methods for writing the response headers and body back to the client.

6. **Calling `Handler`:** The server determines the appropriate handler function based on the request's URL path and other criteria (using the multiplexer). It then calls this handler function, passing the newly created `ResponseWriter` and `*Request` objects as arguments.

7. **Handler Logic:** Your handler function uses the `*Request` object to access the details of the request and the `ResponseWriter` object to construct the response.

8. **Sending Response:** The server takes the response generated by the handler, writes the headers and body to the `net.Conn`, and closes the connection if necessary.
