## What is Partial Application?

Partial application is a technique where you take a function that expects multiple arguments and "fix" some of those arguments, creating a new function that takes the remaining arguments. Essentially, you're pre-filling some of the parameters in advance.

## Why Use Partial Application?

- **Creating Specialized Functions**: You can generate functions tailored for specific tasks by setting certain arguments beforehand.
- **Code Readability**: Complex function calls become easier to understand when broken down into smaller, more focused steps.
- **Function Composition**: It makes it easier to combine smaller functions to build more sophisticated behaviors.

## How Does Partial Application Work?

1. Start with a function that takes multiple arguments.
2. Create a new function that accepts some (or all) of the original arguments.
3. The new function returns another function that takes the remaining arguments.
4. When you finally call the innermost function with all remaining arguments, the original function is executed with all the collected arguments.
